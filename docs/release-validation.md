# Release validation

Releases use two isolated workflows. No pushed tag can publish a package.
Every transition is tied to one final version and one full commit SHA.

1. `Release candidate` requires the candidate to be the current `main` commit,
   builds the exact supported distributions, smoke-installs them on Python 3.11
   and 3.14, creates an SPDX SBOM and content-addressed manifest, and signs
   GitHub build-provenance and SBOM attestations.
2. `Publish approved release` downloads one named candidate run, revalidates
   its commit, file set, sizes, SHA-256 values, and GitHub attestations, then
   waits behind the protected `pypi` environment. Only the exact candidate may
   be sent through PyPI Trusted Publishing. The workflow's scoped GitHub token
   creates the tag and GitHub Release after PyPI verification.

The state machine rejects a reused version unless PyPI already contains the
complete, byte-identical candidate. This permits safe recovery after a
post-upload interruption without enabling replacement or partial releases.

## Prepare a release commit

Use the repository command from clean, synchronized `main`:

```bash
uv sync --locked --extra dev
scripts/release.py prepare
```

The command promotes human-authored changelog notes and updates only the
version metadata files. It does not commit, tag, push, regenerate dependency
graphs, or publish. Dependency changes belong in a separate commit.

Local and CI checks use the committed locks and pinned Rust toolchain:

```bash
python scripts/lock.py
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo check --locked --release
cargo test --locked --lib
pytest -m "not stable_retro"
```

Before publishing, a clean candidate checkout must pass the pinned
original-Stable-Retro semantic oracle and retain its diagnostic receipt outside
the repository. After publishing, regenerate the oracle with
`env-breakoutatari2600-turbo-native@VERSION`; that PyPI-candidate receipt is the release gate:

```bash
make test-semantic-oracle ORACLE_OUTPUT=/external/evidence/breakout-receipt
turbobench oracle breakout/start-v2 \
  --left stable-retro@1.0.1 \
  --right env-breakoutatari2600-turbo-native@VERSION \
  --output /external/evidence/breakout-release-receipt
make verify-semantic-oracle \
  ORACLE_RECEIPT=/external/evidence/breakout-release-receipt
```

The final command is the fail-closed release gate: it requires the complete
4,096-step shapes 1 and 4 workload, `stable-retro==1.0.1` from PyPI, no dirty or
diagnostic provider override, and a PyPI `env-breakoutatari2600-turbo-native` candidate. Public CI
cannot run this private-ROM gate; its ordinary tests validate the harness and
environment contracts but are not cartridge-fidelity evidence.

## Candidate artifacts

Each candidate contains exactly:

- CPython 3.11+ ABI3, macOS 11+, ARM64 wheel;
- CPython 3.11+ ABI3, manylinux glibc 2.28+, x86-64 wheel;
- source archive;
- `SHA256SUMS`;
- `release-manifest.json`; and
- `sbom.spdx.json`.

Linux wheels are built with `Cargo.lock --locked` inside a digest-pinned
official maturin image. The old network-fetched Rust installer is not used.
The source archive is available for inspection and reproducible builds but
does not extend the supported platform set.

## Repository controls

`main` intentionally permits direct maintainer pushes and does not require pull
requests or status checks. CI, package tests, dependency review, and CodeQL
still run as detection and feedback. Release publication remains separate: the
`pypi` environment accepts only the `main` branch, has a wait timer and required
approval, and disallows administrator bypass.

The publish workflow uses its repository-scoped `GITHUB_TOKEN` with
`contents: write` to create the exact `v<version>` tag and GitHub Release. It
does not require a self-hosted parity runner, a Stable Retro repository
variable, GitHub App secrets, or a tag ruleset.

PyPI remains OIDC-only. Never add an API token or use a manual upload as a
shortcut around a failed gate.
