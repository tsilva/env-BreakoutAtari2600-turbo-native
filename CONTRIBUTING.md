# Contributing

Thanks for helping make env-BreakoutAtari2600-turbo-native more useful and trustworthy for the
reinforcement-learning community.

## Before opening a change

- Search existing issues and discussions first.
- Use an issue for a bug report or proposed user-facing change.
- Do not submit ROMs, extracted game assets, reference frames, or save states.
- Keep the supported distribution boundary to Apple-silicon macOS and x86-64
  Linux.

## Development setup

Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and a Rust toolchain, then run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tsilva/env-BreakoutAtari2600-turbo-native.git
cd env-BreakoutAtari2600-turbo-native
uv sync --locked --extra dev --extra play
make develop-release
```

## Required checks

```bash
uv run ruff check .
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --locked --lib
uv run pytest -m "not stable_retro"
```

Changes that can affect the `Start` state's physics, rewards, lifecycle,
observations, or native rendering must pass both the sibling-fork differential
and the exact original-Stable-Retro authority suite:

```bash
make test-stable-retro
make test-semantic-oracle
```

The TurboBench suite pins original `stable-retro==1.0.1` and compares scalar
and four-lane runs for 4,096 seeded transitions, including public native RGB
frames, processed observations, rewards, termination and truncation, selected
info, lane resets, and snapshot continuation. The sibling-fork suite remains a
useful secondary regression check. Both require a locally configured lawful
Breakout ROM. Checkout receipts are development evidence. After publishing the
candidate, regenerate the oracle with `env-breakoutatari2600-turbo-native@VERSION` and verify
that PyPI-candidate receipt outside the repository:

```bash
make verify-semantic-oracle ORACLE_RECEIPT=/external/evidence/receipt
```

[`docs/release-validation.md`](docs/release-validation.md).

## Pull requests

Keep each pull request focused. Explain the user-visible result, tests run, and
any compatibility impact. Add or update tests for behavior changes and update
documentation when the public API changes. By contributing, you agree that your
